<!-- Closures example #2



In the last post, I explained how to create your own #debounce function. We will see how we can create our own #throttle ðŸ›µ function in this post.



The major difference between #debouncing and #throttling is: 

ðŸ‘‰ #debounce calls a function only when a user hasnâ€™t carried out an event in a specific amount of time.

ðŸ‘‰ #throttle calls a function at intervals of a specified amount of time even while the user is carrying out an event. 



The #throttling feature comes in handy when you are making an API call on a button click and don't want to send 100000 API requests for 100000 clicks.
